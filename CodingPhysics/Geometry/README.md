# Geometry - CodingPhysics Project

Welcome to the **Geometry** section of the **CodingPhysics** project! This section is dedicated to exploring key geometric concepts and algorithms through code. Currently, it includes modules that calculate and visualize classic geometric principles such as the **Pythagorean Theorem** and **Rotation of Points**.

The goal of this section is to provide both functional algorithms and visual tools to help you better understand geometry through programming. Each module is designed to allow users to interact with geometric concepts in a hands-on way, reinforcing learning and providing useful tools for both beginners and more experienced programmers.

## Project Overview

The **Geometry** section of the **CodingPhysics** project focuses on the implementation of basic geometric algorithms and their visual representations. The modules included so far are designed to solve fundamental geometric problems and provide a deeper understanding of these concepts.

The project is built in Java and uses graphical tools to enhance the user experience, making abstract concepts more tangible and interactive. Whether you're learning geometry or developing geometric algorithms, this section offers a solid foundation for both educational and practical purposes.

## Modules Included

1. **Pythagorean Theorem**  
   A classic geometric program used to calculate the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.  
   For more details, visit the [Pythagorean Theorem module](https://github.com/nsider4/CodingPhysics/tree/main/CodingPhysics/Geometry/PythagoreanTheorem).

2. **Pythagorean Theorem Visual**  
   A graphical user interface using JavaFX that visualizes the Pythagorean Theorem.  
   For more details, visit the [Pythagorean Theorem Visual module](https://github.com/nsider4/CodingPhysics/tree/main/CodingPhysics/Geometry/PythagoreanTheoremVisual).

3. **Translation Of Points**  
   A simple geometric program that calculates and performs translations.  
   For more details, visit the [Translation Of Points module](https://github.com/nsider4/CodingPhysics/tree/main/CodingPhysics/Geometry/TranslationOfPoints).

4. **Rotation Of Points**  
   A module that calculates everything that encompasses the rotation of points.  
   For more details, visit the [Rotation Of Points module](https://github.com/nsider4/CodingPhysics/tree/main/CodingPhysics/Geometry/RotationOfPoints).

Each module has its own dedicated README file with detailed information on how to use.
