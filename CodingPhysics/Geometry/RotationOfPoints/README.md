# Rotation Calculator

Welcome to the **Rotation Calculator**! This program allows you to perform various geometric operations, such as finding the angle of rotation between two points, determining the perpendicular bisector of two points, and rotating a point around a specified center by a given angle.

## Features

- **Angle of Rotation**: Calculate the angle of rotation between a base and transformed point, with an optional center of rotation.
- **Perpendicular Bisector**: Find the perpendicular bisector between two points.
- **Point Rotation**: Rotate a point around a center by a given angle (clockwise or counterclockwise).
- **Interactive Menu**: Choose options through a simple, user-friendly menu system.


### Requirements

- **Java 17** or higher.
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE.


## Usage

1. **Find the Angle of Rotation**  
   This option calculates the angle of rotation between two points (base and transformed), optionally rotating around a specified center.

    - You will be asked to enter the **base point (image)** coordinates (x, y).
    - You will then be asked to enter the **transformed point (pre-image)** coordinates (x, y).
    - If desired, you can also enter a **center of rotation** (default is (0, 0)).

   The program will calculate the angle of rotation based on these inputs.


2. **Find the Perpendicular Bisector**  
   This option finds the perpendicular bisector between two given points.

- You will be asked to enter the coordinates for **point 1** and **point 2**.
- The program will calculate and display the midpoint, which is the center of the perpendicular bisector.
- The equation of the perpendicular bisector will also be displayed.


3. **Rotate a Point Around a Center**  
   This option rotates a point around a specified center by a given angle (positive for counterclockwise, negative for clockwise).

- You will be asked to enter the **point to rotate** (x, y).
- Then, you will enter the **center of rotation** (x, y).
- Lastly, you will enter the **angle of rotation** in degrees.

The program will perform the rotation and display the new coordinates of the rotated point.


4. **Exit**  
   This option exits the program.
