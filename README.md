# CodingPhysics

Welcome to **CodingPhysics**! This repository is a personal journey into understanding physics through code. As I learn new concepts, I'll be applying them by building algorithms to simulate, solve, and visualize physics principles. Each program aims to answer questions or calculate outcomes related to the concept, combining theoretical learning with practical programming. Once all of the programs for each concept within a course are finished, I'll be creating a website that will let users use and experience the tools with a better interface. Different websites might use a different language for the back-end as a way to gain experience with other programming languages.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. **Learn by Doing**: For each concept in physics that can be modeled or calculated, I will write code to apply it practically.
2. **Conceptual Clarity**: Reinforce understanding of physics principles by implementing them in code.
3. **Building a Resource**: Create a repository that others can reference for learning physics concepts and their implementations.

## ðŸ“š Current Topics Covered

| Concept        | Java Implementation             | Description                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Geometry      | [Geometry Folder](CodingPhysics/Geometry)      | Foundations of math through points, lines, angles, surfaces, etc   |

*New topics and concepts will be added regularly as I progress through my physics journey!*

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any of the Java programs, youâ€™ll need:
- **Java JDK 17** or higher.
- A Java IDE or command line for running the Java files.

1. Clone this repository:
