# CodingPhysics

Welcome to **CodingPhysics**! This repository is a personal journey into understanding physics through code. As I learn new concepts, I'll be applying them by building Java algorithms to simulate, solve, and visualize physics principles. Each program aims to answer questions or calculate outcomes related to the concept, combining theoretical learning with practical programming.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. **Learn by Doing**: For each concept in physics that can be modeled or calculated, I will write Java code to apply it practically.
2. **Conceptual Clarity**: Reinforce understanding of physics principles by implementing them in code.
3. **Building a Resource**: Create a repository that others can reference for learning physics concepts and their Java implementations.

## ðŸ“š Current Topics Covered

| Concept        | Java Implementation             | Description                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanics      | [Mechanics Folder](src/Mechanics)      | Basic equations of motion and velocity calculations.   |
| Thermodynamics | [Thermodynamics Folder](src/Thermodynamics) | Calculating heat transfer using specific heat capacity. |
| Electromagnetism | [Electromagnetism Folder](src/Electromagnetism) | Simulating magnetic fields and forces.                |

*New topics and concepts will be added regularly as I progress through my physics journey!*

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run any of the programs, youâ€™ll need:
- **Java JDK 11** or higher.
- A Java IDE or command line for running the Java files.
